# Password-Encryptor-Decryptor

This Password Encryptor/Decryptor project is a simple Flask-based web application that allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt passwords using the cryptography library's Fernet encryption. Users can input a password to see its encrypted version and then decrypt it back to the original form. The project is easy to set up, requiring only Python and a few dependencies, and provides a straightforward interface for password encryption and decryption tasks.
